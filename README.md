# 🔍 Seeker — AI-Powered Discovery for Web3

Seeker is a decentralized search engine built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) to solve one of the core challenges in Web3: **discoverability**.

Despite the transparency Web3 offers, accessing and navigating decentralized content is fragmented and technically complex. Seeker changes that by introducing an AI-native interface that makes exploring canisters, DAOs, smart contracts, and dApps as intuitive as a conversation.
